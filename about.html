  <div class="title">Competitive solutions since 1991.</div>
  <p class="about-copy1 about-copy1-1">At MPG Media Services, formerly known as Miller Print Group, we specialize in planning, buying and printing outdoor advertising. The potential consumer base is extensive nationwide. Direct advertisers and advertising agencies alike are overwhelmed by the time consuming task of buying and managing outdoor advertising campaigns, and they do not have the significant leverage we can provide in the outdoor advertising business.</p>
  <p class="pull-quote">It is estimated that outdoor advertising dollars will have increased 4% by 2015. This is faster than radio, TV, magazines, or newspapers.</p>
  <div class="about-copy1 about-copy1-2">
    <p>Established in 1991, The Miller Print Group began offering the best printing solutions at a competitive price and managing printing projects for clients around the US. We take advantage of our relationship with printers nationwide to provide the best printing solutions to our customers.<br></p>
    <p>These relationships, and the large volume of business we have generated, affords us preferential pricing delivering competitive pricing to our clients. The evolution of the printing industry and the crisis of 2008 forced The Miller Print Group to develop a new strategy.</p>
    <p>Using our printing industry contacts, we ventured into placement of outdoor advertising. The company still provides valuable services in printing, but in order to illustrate our broader range of services, we converted from The Miller Print Group to MPG Media Services in 2013.</p>
    <p>We are now dedicated to building and managing outdoor advertising campaigns to generate the most value for our clients. We do business in markets throughout the US, with a variety of businesses, such as: Ford Motor Company, Brown Forman, Wendy's, Circle K, Humana and Shoe Carnival.</p>
    <p>We develop, recommend, and execute the most effective advertising campaigns for our clients and aim to provide excellent customer service.</p>
